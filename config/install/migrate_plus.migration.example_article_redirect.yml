# Generates redirects for articles.
#
# Say, the articles we migrated were located at "/blog/SLUG.php" in the legacy site. In the new site, they will be
# accessible at "/node/NID". If we do not do anything with the legacy paths, the old paths will throw "404 Not Found"
# messages at anyone who tries to visit an article at its old path. Getting 404 errors is bad for SEO and reduces our
# website's ranking in various search engines. Thus, we create "301 Moved Permanently" redirects, to map every old
# path to it's equivalent path in Drupal 8.
#
# This migration will generate redirects from "/blog/SLUG.php" to the corresponding node page in the Drupal 8 site.

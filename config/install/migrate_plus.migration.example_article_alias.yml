# Generates additional aliases for articles.
#
# We created "/article/SLUG" type aliases in the "example_article_data" migration. Now, what if we want to have some
# additional aliases pointing to the same nodes such that the nodes are available at two different paths. Say for some
# reason we need to generate aliases in a separate migration! Maybe because the logic for creating URL aliases is
# a bit more complex? Say, for example, we need to migrate some taxonomy terms first and then use the results of that
# migration to generate URL aliases like, "/blog/category-id/article-slug".
#
# This migration will generate URL aliases and point them to the nodes we generated in the "article_data" migration.
# More precisely, we will make "/article/slug.htm" point to the article.

# Migration destination

# Since we want to create URL aliases, we need to use the destination plugin "url_alias" provided by the "path" module.
# Taking a quick look at the plugin source at Drupal\path\Plugin\migrate\destination\UrlAlias::fields(), we can figure
# out the fields supported by this plugin.

  plugin: url_alias

process:
  # Figure out the ID of the corresponding node.
  #
  # Since this field will just be used for computing another property, I have prefixed it with "temp_".
  temp_nid:
    plugin: migration_lookup
    source: slug
    migration: example_article_data
  # Specify the actual path to which are want to define an alias.
  #
  # We want to point to "/node/NID", so we generate that by concatenating various properties.

  # this property, otherwise, you will get errors while running the migration.

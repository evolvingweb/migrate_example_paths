# Generates additional aliases for articles.
#
# We usually migrate node aliases along with node data. Say, for some reason, we want to generate URL aliases in a
# stand-alone migration. This example does exactly that. It uses the category_data migration and the article_data
# migrations and creates URL aliases of the form "/blog/{{ category-slug }}/{{ article-slug }}", which point to the
# articles we migrated in the "article_data" migration.

# We will read the data we have in the source CSV file provided with this example. However, if you are migrating from

# Migration destination
#
# Since we want to create URL aliases, we need to use the destination plugin "url_alias" provided by the "path" module.
# Taking a quick look at the plugin source at Drupal\path\Plugin\migrate\destination\UrlAlias::fields(), we can figure
# out the fields supported by this plugin.

process:
  # Figure out the ID of the corresponding node.
  #
  # Since this field will just be used for computing another property, I have prefixed it with "temp_".
  temp_nid:
    plugin: migration_lookup
    source: slug
    migration: example_article_data
  # Specify the actual path to which are want to define an alias.
  #
  # We want to point to "/node/NID", so we generate that by concatenating various properties.

  # Load category data to generate the "category-slug", which is like a URL friendly version of the category name.

    # First, retrieve the ID of the taxonomy term created during the "category_data" migration.
